## Introduction
This is a monitoring system designed to record temperature and gas readings at 15 minute intervals alongside taking a photo and upload them to the CCCU cloud storage network. 

Within this system is a logging function that allows for a record of when actions have been run and what they are for. This includes when changes are found in the github repository, through the use of Crontab, when script is run for a picture to be taken and the other environmental readings have been taken. The logging system saves the logs in a log.txt file using the ISO 8601 standard for Date and Time, and logging format.

Both power consumtion and processing speed has been considered when designing this system so that it runs smoothly without the consumption of too much resources.

## Prerequisites:
* Python3 and the component PIP3 is used in the gas and temperature monitoring script monitoring script.



_Designed to work on Rasberry Pi OS lite 64 bit._
